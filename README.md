# 🚀 Blockchain for JavaScript Developers

**Learn blockchain by building!** This course teaches blockchain concepts using JavaScript—no Solidity required to get started!

---

## 📖 What's This?

A **practical, code-first** blockchain course for developers who know JavaScript and want to:
- ✅ Understand how blockchain actually works
- ✅ Build DApps (decentralized applications)
- ✅ Get hired in Web3 ($70k-$110k salaries!)
- ✅ Use existing smart contracts (not write them from scratch)

**Time:** ~6-8 hours total  
**Prerequisites:** Basic JavaScript (arrays, objects, functions)  
**Approach:** Copy-paste code, break things, learn by doing!

---

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

### ✅ Perfect for you if:
- Know JavaScript basics
- Want to build DApps
- Curious about blockchain
- Want practical skills (not just theory)
- Prefer learning by coding

### ❌ NOT for you if:
- Want deep cryptography/math
- Only interested in Solidity programming
- Looking for trading/investment advice
