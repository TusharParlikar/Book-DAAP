# Project 01: Hash Explorer Tool

**Chapter:** 01 - Blockchain Fundamentals
**Difficulty:** Beginner
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

---

## üìã Project Description

Build an interactive web application that demonstrates the avalanche effect in cryptographic hashing. Users can input any text and see how even tiny changes create completely different SHA-256 hashes.

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Understand the avalanche effect in hashing
- Work with cryptographic hash functions
- Create interactive educational tools
- Visualize blockchain concepts

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- HTML5
- CSS3 (or Tailwind CSS)
- JavaScript (Vanilla or React)

**Backend/Libraries:**
- CryptoJS library for SHA-256 hashing
- OR Node.js `crypto` module

**Tools:**
- VS Code
- Git/GitHub
- Live Server extension (for testing)

## ‚úÖ TODO List

### Phase 1: Setup
- [ ] Create project folder structure
- [ ] Set up HTML boilerplate
- [ ] Include CryptoJS from CDN or install via npm
- [ ] Create basic CSS styling

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- [ ] Create input textarea for user text
- [ ] Implement SHA-256 hash calculation on input
- [ ] Display hash output in hexadecimal format
- [ ] Add character counter for input

### Phase 3: Avalanche Effect Demo
- [ ] Create side-by-side comparison feature
- [ ] Show original input vs modified input (e.g., "Hello" vs "hello")
- [ ] Highlight character differences in input
- [ ] Show both hashes and highlight differences
- [ ] Add "Compare" button to toggle comparison mode

### Phase 4: Additional Features
- [ ] Add preset examples (blockchain messages, transactions)
- [ ] Implement hash history (last 5 hashes)
- [ ] Add copy-to-clipboard functionality
- [ ] Show hash statistics (length, character distribution)

### Phase 5: Polish
- [ ] Add responsive design for mobile
- [ ] Include educational tooltips
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle
- [ ] Create user guide section

## üí° Hints

**Hint 1: Using CryptoJS**
```javascript
// Include CryptoJS in HTML:
// <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/crypto-js/4.1.1/crypto-js.min.js"></script>

// Calculate SHA-256:
const hash = CryptoJS.SHA256("your text here").toString();
```

**Hint 2: Avalanche Effect Comparison**
- Compare "Blockchain" vs "blockchain" (just lowercase 'b')
- Show that hash is completely different
- Use color coding to highlight changes
- Calculate how many characters changed in the hash (should be ~32 out of 64)

**Hint 3: Visual Difference Highlighting**
- Loop through both hashes character by character
- Apply different CSS class where characters differ
- Use red/green colors for visual impact

**Hint 4: Interesting Test Cases**
- Genesis block message: "The Times 03/Jan/2009..."
- Single character change: "Hello" ‚Üí "Hello!"
- Whitespace matters: "Hello" ‚Üí "Hello "
- Empty string hash

**Hint 5: Educational Additions**
- Explain what SHA-256 means (256-bit = 64 hex characters)
- Show binary representation
- Explain collision resistance
- Link to Bitcoin Genesis block on explorer

## üé® Bonus Challenges

1. **Hash Multiple Algorithms**: Add MD5, SHA-1, SHA-512 comparison
2. **Hash File Upload**: Allow users to upload files and hash them
3. **Block Mining Simulator**: Let users find hash with N leading zeros
4. **Animation**: Animate the avalanche effect with transitions
5. **API Integration**: Connect to blockchain explorer API to show real block hashes
